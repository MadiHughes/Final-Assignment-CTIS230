<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="IMG_6323.jpg" alt="Selfie" width="10%">
<p>My name is Madison Hughes, and I have been an artist as long as I can remember. This website was created to showcase my work from the Guilford College Winter Semester of 2023 dealing with the red color family. All pieces of art are by me, including photographs and videos, unless expressly stated and given proper copyright credit.
  I wish to become an illustrator in some professional capacity in the future.
