<h1>Collages</h1>
<p>Collages are forms of art made by gluing, taping, or otherwise 
  attaching or placing various different materials such as photographs, 
  newspaper clippings, etc. Here are three examples of physical newspaper
   collages, showcasing various shades of red, orange, and violet. Cut by
    hand with an exacto knife, these collage elements are individually 
    placed within each black square and/or rectangle. Despite the fact that they may
     have no particular narrative meaning, the formation of full pieces by placing 
     unrelated pieces together to make a full piece is very interesting, and is a
      very intricate process.</p>
